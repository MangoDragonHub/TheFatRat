# TheFatRat

My interactive story is called The Fat Rat. A small comedic tale of the a Fat Rat trying to become strong and lose weight and show off against a big strong Cat. Why did chose this direction of my Twine project? I weirdly thought Tom and Jerry at first in combination of actual animals. The Rat and Cat are domesticated so they're not harming either space.
